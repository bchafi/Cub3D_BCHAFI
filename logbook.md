### DAY 1

I went to look for some infor about raycasting , howevr i ended up reading about raytracing, from what i understood in practice it is something about projecting the light from a light source to the eye, it depends on a lot of factors like the texturing of the object , but in general it is related to light reaching the eye, in computer words it is applied in reverse (reverse tracing) by starting the ray of light from the eye/camera towards the object and then looking for the light source.
i also looked at how can i draw a rectangle and how are colors used with mlx42, and started playing with some hooks for closing the program, i know that they're not ready but for a basis they are good enough for now.
from what i heard from elkess , i should start by making a 2d map then draw it , the map would be  containing symbols that would express objects such as the player , the walls , the empty space where the player can move , doors .etc. the map would need the tiles to be multiplied by a size that can allow it to appear in the window. and then i'm supposed to map the player's location.

### DAY 2

Today i managed to finish making the map , created on the stack , instead of the heap for now, all the elemens are color coded , i also added a small timer for fun , i managed to make hooks work to a certain extent, i added some files and hooks , i still need to work on textures and images a bit more.
